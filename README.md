## Introduction

In today's fast-paced tech world, strong problem-solving skills are crucial. This repository provides a structured approach to learning programming concepts and DSA. You will find problems to solve, resources to study, and a supportive community to help you along the way.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sousovski/binary-blitz-workshop.git
```

Once cloned, navigate to the directory:

```bash
cd binary-blitz-workshop
```

You can explore various folders containing resources in C, C++, and Java. 

## Resources

### Programming Languages

We offer resources in three popular programming languages:

- **C**: Known for its efficiency and control, C is a great choice for learning the fundamentals of programming.
- **C++**: Building on C, C++ introduces object-oriented programming, making it suitable for larger projects.
- **Java**: A versatile language used in many applications, Java is a good choice for those interested in web and mobile development.

### Data Structures and Algorithms

Understanding data structures and algorithms is essential for efficient programming. This repository covers:

- **Arrays**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks**
- **Queues**
- **Trees**
- **Graphs**
- **Sorting Algorithms**
- **Searching Algorithms**

Each section includes explanations, code examples, and problems to solve.

## Problem Solving

Problem-solving is a skill that improves with practice. We provide a variety of problems ranging from easy to hard. 

1. **Easy Problems**: Great for beginners to get comfortable with coding.
2. **Medium Problems**: For those who want to challenge themselves.
3. **Hard Problems**: Designed for advanced learners looking to refine their skills.

You can find these problems in the `problems` directory. Each problem includes a description, input/output format, and sample test cases.
